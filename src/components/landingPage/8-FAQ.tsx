      question: "What is the difference between NotaBeen Core (Free) and Professional (Paid)?",
      answer:
        "NotaBeen Core is the free, MIT-licensed, self-hostable open-source engine, perfect for users who prioritize absolute data sovereignty. It handles basic categorization and a clean dashboard. NotaBeen Professional is our managed SaaS offering. It includes advanced Intelligent Prioritization (Risk Mitigation), automated reply drafting, and a generous allowance of AI Actions (our monetization metric, like summaries and analysis) without the burden of self-hosting.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does NotaBeen ensure my data privacy and security?",
      answer:
        "Our Open Core model is our security moat. You can audit the entire codebase (Core) to verify our data handling practices. For the Professional managed service, your data is processed in a secure, private cloud environment and is never used to train AI models or sold to third parties. You always retain control and transparency.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do 'AI Actions' work, and how are they tied to my cost?",
      answer:
        "AI Actions are our core monetization metric. They are defined as high-value, resource-intensive AI operations, such as generating an in-depth thread summary, performing sentiment analysis, or drafting an advanced reply. NotaBeen Professional includes unlimited AI Actions per month, offering a clear, measurable ROI by saving you time on high-stakes tasks.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the pricing for NotaBeen Professional?",
      answer:
        "The NotaBeen Professional hosted service is priced at â‚¬28.99 per user, per month. You can receive a discount by choosing the annual plan. The self-hosted NotaBeen Core is free (open-source), with the only cost being your private server hosting fees.",
